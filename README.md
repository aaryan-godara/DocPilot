## 📋 Problem Statement

Reading through long PDF documents to find specific information is time-consuming and inefficient. **DocPilot** solves this by building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that lets users upload PDF documents, ask natural-language questions, and receive precise answers with **citations and page numbers** — grounded in the actual document content.

## 📝 What I Learned

- **Week 1:**
  - Setting up a clean project structure early saves a lot of time later.
  - FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI docs (`/docs`) make testing endpoints very easy.
  - Using `pydantic-settings` for configuration keeps environment management clean and type-safe.
  - Separating routes into individual files (health, upload) keeps the codebase modular and readable.

- **Week 2:**
  - **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)** is extremely fast for PDF text extraction — it handles page-level access natively, which is essential for building citation features later.
  - **Page-number tracking through the chunking process** was the trickiest part. Since chunks can straddle page boundaries (due to overlap), I had to build a character-offset mapping to trace each chunk back to its source page(s).
  - **LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`** is smart about splitting — it tries paragraph and sentence boundaries before falling back to character-level splits, which produces more meaningful chunks.
  - Choosing the right **chunk size and overlap** is a design trade-off: smaller chunks give more precise retrieval but lose context; larger chunks preserve context but may dilute relevance. The defaults (1000 chars / 200 overlap) are a good starting point.
  - **Dataclasses** (`PageContent`, `DocumentChunk`) make it much easier to pass structured data between services compared to raw dictionaries.
  - Writing tests *alongside* the code (not after) caught edge cases early — e.g., empty PDFs, single-chunk documents, and page boundary tracking.

- **Week 3:**
  - **The xAI API being OpenAI SDK-compatible** is a huge win — switching LLM providers is literally changing `base_url` and `api_key`.
  - **Lazy initialization is critical for developer experience.** Without it, every `uvicorn --reload` would load the 80 MB embedding model. With it, the server starts in <1 second.
  - **Prompt engineering matters more than model size** for citation quality. The system prompt explicitly instructs `[Page X]` format and "only answer from context."
  - **ChromaDB's upsert** saves a lot of complexity — re-processing is idempotent, no duplicate detection needed.
  - **Mocking the LLM in tests** is essential — pipeline tests shouldn't require an API key or hit a real endpoint.
